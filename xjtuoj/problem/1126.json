There are two positive integers that divide $7$ by $1$ and $7$. $25$ is not a less-3 number. There are $1$, $5$ and $25$ that can divide $25$.\r\n\r\nNow, Sheauhaw is curious about how many less-3 numbers are included between positive integers $L$ and $R$. Please help the curious Sheauhaw to answer his questions."},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"The first line has a positive integer of $T$, which represents the total number of test data.\r\n\r\nEach test data is a line of two integers $L,R$."},{"title":"输出格式","type":"output_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"Please output one line for each test data. \r\n\r\nFor each test data, please output the proportion of less-3 numbers between $L$ and $R$ (including $L$ and $R$)."},{"title":"样例","type":"example","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"#### 样例输入\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n3\r\n7 7\r\n25 25\r\n5 14\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 样例输出\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n1\r\n0\r\n4\r\n```"},{"title":"数据范围与提示","type":"limit_and_hint","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"$1≤T≤50$\r\n\r\n$1 \\le L \\le R \\le 10^7$"}]}
