In this technology, distributed users share a common list of records (called the chain), and a user has the right to add a new record to the chain by solving a mathematical problem. This process is called mining. The i-Taiwan company has developed up a new digital currency system, called the ICPC (I-taiwan Coins for the Public Currency). In the ICPC system, its mathematical problem for mining is as follows. Given positive integer $n$, the problem asks one to find the largest integer a such that\r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{a \\oplus b} + \\frac{1}{b}\r\n$$\r\n\r\n, for some positive integer $b$ where $\\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or operator. For example, for $n = 12$, its solution is $a = 145$. In this case, $b = 13$ and thus $a \\oplus b = 145 \\oplus 13 = 100100012 \\oplus 11012 = 100111002 = 156$.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{1}{a \\oplus b} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{156} + \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{n}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nYou are an ambitious programmer, and you want to mine a lot of digital coins from this system in a short time. Please write a program to find the largest a for each n in order to earn the rewards from ICPC."},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"The first line of the input file contains exactly one positive integer $T$ that gives you the number of test cases.
