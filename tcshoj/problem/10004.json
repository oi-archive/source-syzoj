They have different names – bubbles, pearls, and tapioka. People start thinking to put almost every food together with tapioka. E.g., bubble tea pizza, bubble tea ramen, bubble tea hotpot, bubble tea cake, and so on.\r\n\r\nGiven the name of a dish, you are going to repeatedly remove all the tapioka part and reveal the true colors of that dish. Notice that the dishes in this problem will consist of exactly three words. Every dish always starts with either the term “bubble tea” or “tapioka”. For example, you may observe a dish named “bubble tea ramen”, but you will never observe a dish named “bubble ramen tea”."},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"The input file contains exactly one test case.
