Therefore, Alex, a truck driver in this growing industry, was supposed to transport several parcels scattering in the warehouse to other cities in his daily routine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official safety requirements to the trucks running in the highway, Alex had to tie up all the packages tightly so that he could settle the goods safely on his truck. Alex knew that the length of the cords needed for bundling the packages on the truck was based on the size of the packages themselves. Also, $n$ packages can be tied up well after $n − 1$ bundles. Moreover, when bundling goods, Alex could only bundle two packages at one time to avoid scattering. Since the daily consumption of the cord was great and Alex was supposed to pay for it, he hopes to bundle all the goods with the shortest cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, there are $4$ parcels in the size of $8, 5, 14,$ and $26$ respectively. If Alex binds the first two together, the needed rope will be in the length of $13 (8+5 = 13)$ while the needed rope for the latter two packages will be $40 (14 + 26 = 40)$. If Alex keeps bundling these two items, the rope length he needs will be $53 (13 + 40 = 53)$. So the total length of the $4$ packages will be $106 (13 + 40 + 53 = 106)$. If Alex tries another way by bundling the first two $(8 + 5 = 13)$, adding up the third one $(13 + 14 = 27)$, and then bundling the last item $(27 + 14 = 53)$, he will only need the cord in the length of $93 (13 + 27 + 53 = 93)$. Now your mission is to help Alex finding the minimum length of the needed cord."},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the number of test cases.
