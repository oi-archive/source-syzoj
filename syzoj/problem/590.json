She does not want to get to her old home too quickly, because she likes the scenery along the way. She has decided to take the second-shortest rather than the shortest path. She knows there must be some second-shortest path.\r\n\r\nThe countryside consists of $R (1 ≤ R ≤ 100,000)$ bidirectional roads, each linking two of the $N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000) $ intersections, conveniently numbered $1..N$. Bessie starts at intersection 1, and her friend (the destination) is at intersection $N$.\r\n\r\nThe second-shortest path may share roads with any of the shortest paths, and it may backtrack i.e., use the same road or intersection more than once. The second-shortest path is the shortest path whose length is longer than the shortest path(s) (i.e., if two or more shortest paths exist, the second-shortest path is the one whose length is longer than those but no longer than any other path)."},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"- Line $1$ : Two space-separated integers: $N$ and $R$ \r\n\r\n- Lines $2..R+1$ : Each line contains three space-separated integers: $A, B,$ and $D$ that describe a road that connects intersections $A$ and $B$ and has length $D (1 ≤ D ≤ 5000)$"},{"title":"输出格式","type":"output_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"Line $1$ : The length of the second shortest path between node $1$ and node $N$"},{"title":"样例","type":"example","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"#### Sample Input\r\n```cpp\r\n4 4\r\n1 2 100\r\n2 4 200\r\n2 3 250\r\n3 4 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Sample Output\r\n```cpp\r\n450\r\n```"},{"title":"数据范围与提示","type":"limit_and_hint","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"#### Hint\r\n\r\nTwo routes: $1 \\to 2 \\to 4 (length 100+200=300)$ and $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 (length 100+250+100=450)$\r\n\r\n$1 ≤ R ≤ 100,000$\r\n\r\n$1 ≤ N ≤ 5000$"}]}
