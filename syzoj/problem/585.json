Each vertex is labelled with an integer and each edge is labelled with either the symbol $+$ (addition) or the symbol $*$ (product). The edges are numbered from $1$ to $N$. \r\n\r\n![](http://poj.org/images/1179_1.jpg)\r\n\r\nOn the first move, one of the edges is removed. Subsequent moves involve the following steps: \r\n\r\n- pick an edge E and the two vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$ that are linked by $E$; and \r\n\r\n- replace them by a new vertex, labelled with the result of performing the operation indicated in $E$ on the labels of $V_1$ and $V_2$. \r\n\r\nThe game ends when there are no more edges, and its score is the label of the single vertex remaining. \r\n\r\nConsider the polygon of Figure $1$. The player started by removing edge $3$. After that, the player picked edge $1$, then edge $4$, and, finally, edge $2$. The score is $0$. \r\n\r\n![](http://poj.org/images/1179_2.jpg)\r\n\r\nWrite a program that, given a polygon, computes the highest possible score and lists all the edges that, if removed on the first move, can lead to a game with that score. \r\n\r\n"},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"Your program is to read from standard input. The input describes a polygon with $N$ vertices. It contains two lines. On the first line is the number $N$. The second line contains the labels of edges $1, ..., N$, interleaved with the vertices' labels (first that of the vertex between edges $1$ and $2$, then that of the vertex between edges $2$ and $3$, and so on, until that of the vertex between edges $N$ and $1$), all separated by one space. An edge label is either the letter $t$ (representing $+$) or the letter $x$ (representing $*$). \r\n\r\n$3 <= N <= 50$\r\n\r\nFor any sequence of moves, vertex labels are in the range $[-32768,32767]$.
