Their sides are all vertical or horizontal. Each rectangle can be partially or totally covered by the others. The length of the boundary of the union of all rectangles is called the perimeter. \r\n\r\nWrite a program to calculate the perimeter. An example with 7 rectangles is shown in Figure $1$. \r\n\r\n![](http://poj.org/images/1177_1.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding boundary is the whole set of line segments drawn in Figure $2$. \r\n\r\n![](http://poj.org/images/1177_2.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe vertices of all rectangles have integer coordinates. \r\n\r\n"},{"title":"输入格式","type":"input_format","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"Your program is to read from standard input.
